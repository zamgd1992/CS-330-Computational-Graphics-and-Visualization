# CS-330
This project was the first time I used the API OpenGL.
I learned a lot while working on this.
The first and biggest thing I took out of this project was how to learn a new API.
Not everything is going to come easily or intuitively.
That is why it was useful to find tutorials on how to accomplish what I wanted to do.&nbsp;
The other thing that was helpful while working through this project was iteration.
It was helpful to have small goals each week to learn the parts necessary for the project.
First It was rendering a 2D object, then a 3D object.
Then learning how to add camera controls. This helped a lot in learning everything.
Being able to navigate through the 3D space helped understand what changing certain parts of the object really did.
Learning how to render multiple objects and then placing them throughout the 3D space came next.
Then I learned how to add textures to the objects and realistic lighting.&nbsp;
It was really taking these steps one at a time that helped learn the API.

Learning processes on how to begin using a new API was one of the biggest things I will take from this project.
In the future as I continue my education and career, I will inevitably have to learn new languages and APIs.
Taking the knowledge gained form this project will help me do that more effectively.&nbsp;
The other thing that I will take from this project is the theory behind rendering objects.&nbsp;
This project had me actually practice the theory behind using matrices or vertices to render objects in 3D.
This will also be useful in my career as I continue pursuing software development.
